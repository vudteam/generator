### This is just a dummy post to fill space up ;)

## Getting Started

Today we will learn about __coding__ a post. The official style is markdown, and you will never have a perfect database to look upon while you write, so thats when jekyll came handy. I love doing stuffs like this, especially coding stuffs, and i believe this will grow on a regular basis.

### Features:

- A shitpost.
- Short and precise.
- Evalangle free.
- Demo for dummy.
- Get shit done.

```
live_life():
	job.OnProcessExecution('Eat')
	job.OnProcessExecution('Breathe')
	job.OnProcessExecution('Code')
	job.OnProcessExecution('Sleep')

do:
	live_life()
while(alive):
```

Filled space with trash :p
