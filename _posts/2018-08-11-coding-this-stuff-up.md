### Wtf is all this?

Well this trash stuff is the result of mine 3 continuous days with least possible amount of rest.

### Why are u doing this?

Tough question to answer, but I guess it is all because I was assigned to do a task of setting up a website by Biproda. And to keep my word, prove my worth to be a part of the team and most importantly to learn, I am doing all these stuff. And trust me, my knowledge in web development maybe increased a 10x times from the time i had started coding up this website.

### Wait, what?

Yep, i had already started coding for my former team last December but after 2 months, the project got stagnated after my team member deserted me. But I never wanted my 2 weeks of toil to go waste. maybe thats another reason why i proposed setting up all this stuff. :').

Oh and btw, you gotta know something, this blog was a part of a Jekyll theme. The CMS wasn't coded by me. However significant changes have been made here. you can take a look at the sources and the differences between them. :') i added support for purple theme (trust me that was heck doing that, i had to manually go through unreadable lines of source codes under `assets/built/.css` and modding every occurance of a different theme color/style interface), added authors, different tags, and modded some other stuff like `truncation limit`, `overflow specs`, `error init pages` and other stuff.

### What did you learn?

Lots mate, lots. I learnt coding a custom CMS wasn't that hard. You just gotta keep learning. And maybe that is going to be my next project... __MAYBE__, A Custom CMS with proprietry features. Sure enough if it comes up, it gotta be open-source. Baice. :)

Also while going through the modular structure, i discovered some bugs, 

#### How easy was this?

Trust me, many of you think that modding an open-source blog is just easy af, but trust me it isnt. there are thousands of areas where you wouldn't want to agree with the already present modules. 

#### Am I am a pro, then?

No shit Sherlock, I are nothing. There is a hell world to learn.
